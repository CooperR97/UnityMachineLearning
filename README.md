# Unity Machine Learning
Unity has an experimental Machine Learning module that is available to the public. This readme is designed for *Mac* users. 
Its purpose is to provide a quick start guide to get the ml-agents model up and running the pretrained model included with ml-agents and to quickly transition to training your own model.

## Quick Start Guide:
